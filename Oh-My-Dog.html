  <p>This is Dolce! My best friend. He is 9 months old. His best friend is Scar. Dolce enjoys outdoor activities which
    include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walks</li>
    <li>Playing with other dogs</li>
    <li>Playing fetch</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dolce has a favorite toy-The Patrick Star doll. His favorite meal is meat ofcourse. Dolce is a jealous dog though.
    It barks at the sight of people paying attention to other dogs and not him. Dolce's likes and dislikes are:</p>
  <ul><strong>His Likes:</strong>
    <li>Belly rubs</li>
    <li>Ear rubs</li>
  </ul>
  <ul><strong>His Dislikes</strong>
    <li>Bathing</li>
    <li>Grooming</li>
  </ul>
